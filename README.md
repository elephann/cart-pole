# CartPole

Gym ai cart pole environment implemented using deep reinforcement learning with keras

https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/

## The Cross-Entropy Method

So, our cross-entropy method is model-free, policy-based, and on-policy, which means the following:

* It doesn't build any model of the environment; it just says to the agent what to do at every step
* It approximates the policy of the agent
* It requires fresh data obtained from the environment

## Run

```
pipenv run python card-pole-control.py
```
